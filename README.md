The Sports Message Board allows you to create users, posts, and teams. 

You can post about a specific team and it will show up on the main posts page and on the teams page it is attributed too.

A user can not delete or edit posts not made by that user.

A user must be logged in to see any posts or teams.

A team can not be destroyed or altered, but the posts made by the current user that is logged in can be changed or deleted.
